# MCSC6040-FinalProject

This is the repository that stores my final project in my Simulating Discrete Units course. This project implements the algorithm found in the 1992 paper https://hal.science/jpa-00246697v1/document. The code involves using cellular automata to model traffic flow in a one lane road. In this project, I also add to the model to predict the effects of weather and the effects of speed limits.
